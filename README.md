# beesect

My early port of the Python `bisect` library to the Dart language.

Unit tests of this dart library are automatically generated by the Python
module. Therefore, I expect a high degree of conformity of the results to the
original.

# Example

```dart
import 'package:beesect/beesect.dart';

void main() {
  sorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];
  print(bisectRightNum(items, 5));
}
```
